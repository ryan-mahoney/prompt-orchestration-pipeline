# Remaining Steps for Scoped File I/O Implementation

## Completed Work ✅

### Step 1: Core File I/O Module

- [x] Created `createTaskFileIO` factory with curried functions
- [x] Implemented writeArtifact/writeLog/writeTmp with modes
- [x] Implemented readArtifact/readLog/readTmp operations
- [x] Added automatic tasks-status.json updates with de-duplication
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite (21 tests passing)
- [x] Added atomic writes and error handling
- [x] Maintained pure functional design with closures

### Step 2: UI Schema Migration (Prerequisite)

- [x] Updated job-adapter to prefer files.\* over legacy artifacts
- [x] Modified status-transformer to handle new files.\* schema
- [x] Updated JobDetail component to render files.\* instead of task.artifacts
- [x] Updated tests to expect new files.\* schema
- [x] All UI tests passing with new schema
- [x] Updated storage.md and tasks-data-shape.md documentation

## Current Work: Step 2 - Inject files API into Stage Context

### In Progress

- [ ] Analyze task-runner.js to understand current stage context creation
- [ ] Modify task-runner to create per-task fileIO singleton using createTaskFileIO
- [ ] Set context.files before stage invocation in task-runner
- [ ] Add statusPath to runner context in pipeline-runner.js
- [ ] Ensure task folders exist on start in task-runner
- [ ] Write context.output via files.writeArtifact instead of legacy artifacts
- [ ] Remove legacy artifacts enumeration/writes from task-runner
- [ ] Update runner tests to reflect new file I/O approach
- [ ] Add integration test for stage context.files usage
- [ ] Verify file operations work correctly within stage context

## Remaining Steps

### Step 3: Demo Task Updates

- [ ] Modify demo task in demo/pipeline-config/tasks/ to use writeArtifact/writeLog
- [ ] Showcase default modes (append for logs, replace for artifacts)
- [ ] Add integration test for demo pipeline with new file I/O
- [ ] Verify demo generates correct files.\* structure

### Step 4: API and Endpoint Updates

- [ ] Update job-detail endpoint to return files.\* instead of legacy artifacts
- [ ] Remove legacy artifacts fields from API responses
- [ ] Update API integration tests to expect new schema
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility is properly broken as intended

### Step 5: Migration and Cleanup

- [ ] Create migration script for existing demo data
- [ ] Move legacy files to new task subfolders (artifacts/, logs/, tmp/)
- [ ] Rewrite tasks-status.json to new schema with files.\* arrays
- [ ] Add sanity tests for migration script
- [ ] Test migration on existing demo data

### Step 6: Final Validation

- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Execute demo pipeline in temp workspace with new file I/O
- [ ] Validate file placement and schema updates in pipeline-data
- [ ] Update README with verification notes for new file I/O system
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass across entire suite

### Step 7: Documentation and PR

- [ ] Prepare comprehensive PR description with breaking changes
- [ ] Document migration path for existing users
- [ ] Request review with clear checklist of changes
