  "reasoning": "1. FIRST: Found an exported schema constant named 'synthesisJsonSchema' at the top of the source code, which directly defines the JSON schema for the artifact. 2. SECOND: Verified this schema is used in the 'validateStructure' stage to validate the 'synthesis-output.json' artifact after it's written in the 'inference' stage, confirming it's the correct schema. 3. THIRD: The LLM prompt in 'promptTemplating' explicitly instructs the model to output JSON matching this exact structure, reinforcing the schema requirements. 4. FOURTH: The schema includes all required fields (title, paragraphs, conclusion) with string types and array constraints, and sets 'additionalProperties: false' to enforce strict adherence. No further analysis was needed as the schema is directly provided and validated in the code."
