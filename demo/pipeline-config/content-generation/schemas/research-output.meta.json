  "reasoning": "1. FIRST: Found an exported schema constant named 'researchJsonSchema' at the top of the source code, which matches the artifact 'research-output.json' as it's used for validation in stages like 'validateStructure' and 'finalValidation'. This schema is explicitly defined with all required properties and constraints. 2. SECOND: Located io.writeArtifact calls for 'research-output.json' in the 'inference' and 'finalValidation' stages, where the data written is parsed from LLM responses, and the schema validation ensures the structure matches 'researchJsonSchema'. 3. THIRD: The prompt in 'promptTemplating' provides a JSON structure hint that aligns with the schema, confirming the expected fields like 'researchSummary', 'keyFindings' array with objects containing 'area', 'findings', and optional 'sources'. 4. FOURTH: The 'validateStructure' and 'finalValidation' stages use 'validateWithSchema' with 'researchJsonSchema' to validate the artifact content, directly linking the schema to the artifact. Thus, the schema is fully defined and validated in the code."
