  "reasoning": "1. FIRST: Found exported schema constant 'formattingJsonSchema' that matches the artifact, as it's used in validateStructure to validate 'formatting-output.json'. This schema defines an object with required property 'formattedContent' of type string and minLength 1, with additionalProperties false.\n2. SECOND: In inference stage, io.writeArtifact writes 'formatting-output.json' with parsedResponse, which is parsed from LLM response. The prompt in promptTemplating specifies JSON output structure with 'formattedContent', aligning with the schema.\n3. THIRD: The prompt explicitly instructs to produce JSON with 'formattedContent', and the code parses response.content to extract this property, confirming the schema structure.\n4. FOURTH: validateStructure uses formattingJsonSchema to validate the artifact, reinforcing that the schema accurately describes the artifact's structure."
