  "reasoning": "1. FIRST: Found an exported schema constant 'researchJsonSchema' at the top of the source code, which matches the artifact as it's used for validation in 'finalValidation' stage for 'research-output-2.json'. 2. SECOND: Located the io.writeArtifact call for 'research-output-2.json' in the 'refine' stage, where the data 'parsed' is written after JSON parsing from an LLM response. 3. THIRD: The prompt in 'promptTemplating' explicitly defines the JSON structure expected from the LLM, which aligns with the schema's properties and requirements. 4. FOURTH: The 'validateStructure' and 'finalValidation' stages use 'researchJsonSchema' to validate artifacts, confirming it's the correct schema for 'research-output-2.json'. The schema was directly extracted from the exported constant, ensuring it's valid JSON Schema Draft-07 with all required fields."
