# Step 4 - API Endpoint Updates

## Completed Work

✅ Step 1: Core File I/O Module

- Created `createTaskFileIO` factory with comprehensive functionality
- Implemented writeArtifact/writeLog/writeTmp with modes
- Added automatic tasks-status.json updates with de-duplication
- Created comprehensive test suite (21 tests passing)
- Maintained pure functional design with closures

✅ Step 2: Inject files API into Stage Context

- Modified task-runner to create per-task fileIO singleton using createTaskFileIO
- Added statusPath to runner context in pipeline-runner.js
- Set context.files before stage invocation with proper error handling
- Ensured task folders exist on start in task-runner
- Removed legacy artifacts enumeration/writes from task-runner
- All task-runner and pipeline-runner tests passing (29/29)

✅ Step 3: Demo Task Updates

- Updated demo/pipeline-config/tasks/analysis/index.js to use new file I/O API
- Added context.files.writeLog calls for ingestion and integration stages
- Write raw-research.json artifact with metadata using writeArtifact
- Create analysis-output.json and analysis-summary.txt artifacts
- Demonstrate default modes (append for logs, replace for artifacts)
- Created comprehensive integration test for file I/O functionality (5/5 passing)

✅ UI Schema Migration (Prerequisite)

- Updated job-adapter to prefer files.\* over legacy artifacts
- Modified status-transformer to handle new files.\* schema
- Updated JobDetail component to render files.\* instead of task.artifacts
- Updated tests to expect new files.\* schema
- All UI tests passing with new schema
- Updated storage.md and tasks-data-shape.md documentation

## Current Phase Objective

Update API endpoints to return files.\* instead of legacy artifacts, ensuring complete migration to the new schema.

## Implementation Requirements

### API Endpoint Updates

**Files to modify:**

- `src/ui/endpoints/job-detail-endpoint.js` - Update to return files.\* schema

**Changes needed:**

1. **Update job-detail endpoint**:
   - Remove legacy artifacts field from responses
   - Ensure files.\* arrays are properly included in task objects
   - Maintain backward compatibility handling if needed
   - Update any response formatting logic

2. **Remove legacy artifacts fields**:
   - Ensure no task.artifacts references remain in API responses
   - Verify only files.\* schema is returned
   - Update any middleware or transformation logic

3. **Update API integration tests**:
   - Modify tests to expect files.\* instead of legacy artifacts
   - Test that legacy artifacts are not present in responses
   - Verify correct files.\* structure and content

### Success Criteria

- Job detail endpoint returns only files.\* schema
- No legacy artifacts fields in API responses
- All API integration tests pass with new schema
- Backward compatibility is properly broken as intended
- End-to-end API testing confirms correct behavior

## Next Step

After completing Step 4, proceed to Step 5 to create migration script for existing demo data.
